# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step 1: Import the NumPy library to work with arrays and matrix operations.
### Step 2: Create the 3×3 matrix as a NumPy array.
### Step 3: Use np.linalg.inv() to calculate the inverse of the matrix.
### Step 4: Print the inverse matrix.
